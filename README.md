# web-automation-prototype

- built with the pond worker pool and shopify's lua interpreter for golang
- if good progress is made frontend will be built with wails + svelte 
- lua is used to interface with google's blockly (visual scripting library)
- still undecided on whether to go with a node based visual scripting library or not
