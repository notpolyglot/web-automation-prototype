instead of having lua-> golang http. i tihnk it maeks more sense to have the functions simply represent the logic it WANTS to do, and just extract the data, instead of actually executing it.
so for example in lua:
http.get("google.com")
instead of the get function actually running a get request, it should instead send the data to the queue and mark it as a get request. this means it can queue up jobs and execute it quickyl
im not really sure if this would be faster or not but it makes sense to me
